	    <h3 class='mb-3'>Welcome to the NIBRS Services Toolset</h3>
	    <p>The NIBRS Services Toolset is made avaiable for use by law enforcement through funding by the U. S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics in conjunction with the F.B.I. to provide services and capabilities to assist law enforcement agencies in their transition to the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS).  This toolset is free to use.
	    </p>
	    <p>The toolset currently offers two capabilities: The NIBRS Pre-Certification Tool (PCT) and NIBRS to Summary Reports (N2S).
	    </p>
	    <p>The NIBRS Pre-Certification Tool (PCT) can be used by state and local law enforcement agencies to “pre-check” their NIBRS records to identify potential data submission or validation errors.  The tool accepts NIBRS data in either the legacy flat file format or the XML format.  The tool processes NIBRS records interactively using the FBI’s 2019.1 NIBRS rules and provides a list of errors following the standard FBI error file format, which can be downloaded for resolution in a variety of formats (Excel, CSV or PDF).  Once records are processed, they are deleted and not retained in any fashion.  There are limitations to the tool which are explained on the PCT page.  
	    </p>
	    <p>The NIBRS to Summary Reports (N2S) capability allows users to produce 8 standard Summary reports from NIBRS data submissions.  This allows users to compare NIBRS crime counts against their legacy Summary reports.  Reports are produced interactively and the user has several options for filtering report contents.  More information about the summary reporting capabilities provided on the N2S/Summary Reports page.
