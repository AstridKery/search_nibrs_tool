				<p>The NIBRS Pre-Certification Tool provides law enforcement agencies responsible for submitting incident data to state Incident-Based Reporting (IBR) programs the ability to test their submissions before formally submitting data to their state IBR programs.  State IBR programs can also use the Pre-Certification Tool to test their submissions before beginning the NIBRS certification process with the FBI.    </p>
				<p>The Pre-Cert Tool exercises all of the NIBRS data edit and validation rules and provides formatted output of errors so submitters can correct their data submissions and, ultimately, speed the certification process.  Important note: The validation rules included in this tool only reflect the FBIâ€™s NIBRS data and do not include state-specific data elements and rules.  Likewise, the tool cannot validate some NIBRS rules specific to the submitting agency (Add exceptions)  </p>
