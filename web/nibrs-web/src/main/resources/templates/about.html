				<hr/>
				<p>The NIBRS Pre-Certification Tool provides agencies responsible for submitting data to the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data to state Incident Based Reporting (IBR) programs or the FBI the ability to test their data submissions for accuracy prior to formally working with the state or FBI to begin the NIBRS Certification process.  The Pre-Cert tool can also be used by state IBR programs in preparation for submitting data to the FBI.  The Pre-Cert tool exercises all of the NIBRS data edit and validation rules and provides formatted output of errors so submitters can correct their data submissions and, ultimately, speed the certification process.  </p>

Results can be viewed here or downloaded as a spreadsheet (CSV file) or PDF.  The tool currently accepts text files formatted in the flat file format defined in the NIBRS Version 3.1 standard.  <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs_technical_specification_version_3.1_pdf">https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs_technical_specification_version_3.1_pdf</a> </p>
