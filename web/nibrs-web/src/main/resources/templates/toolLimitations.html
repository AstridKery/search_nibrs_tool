				<p>There are some NIBRS rules that the Pre-Certification Tool (PCT) cannot enforce because the validation relies on access to previously submitted incidents or specific FBI information on the submitting agency. There are other differences between the PCT Report and FBI Error Data Set (EDS) due to different interpretations of the rules. These are being addressed with the FBI and the PCT will be updated to be consistent with the FBI Report. </p>
