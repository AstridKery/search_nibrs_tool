        <h1>NIBRS Demo Dataset</h1>

        <p >The data provided within this demo instance of Saiku comes from the Inter-University Consortium for Political
          and Social Research (<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/">ICPSR</a>) <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/128">NIBRS repository</a>.</p>

        <p>We have loaded the 2015 data for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from the ICPSR repository into the tool for demo purposes.
          We chose Massachusetts because it has a large enough body of
          data to be interesting, without creating too large of a database.  Note that the ICPSR NIBRS data for Massachusetts does not include all agencies in the Commonwealth (as is
          true for most states.)</p>
